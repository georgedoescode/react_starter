# React + Webpack Boilerplate / Starter 

Because setting up a webpack config for all this stuff is **10 / 10** arduos, I have done a boilerplate...

I know... there are tons of other boilerplates online, but I get anxious using someone elses so this one has to exist.

It might be a bit easier to hack on than CRA, and it sometimes helps to see what is going
on under the hood so feel free to use it / extend it however you like 👍

## What it comes with

+ react (16.7.0-alpha.2) for nice hooks
+ pointless emojis
+ 💅 styled components 
+ postcss  
  + autoprefixer
  + minifier
+ eslint (extends airbnb)
+ a dev server 
+ a production build step 
+ general stuff such as:
  + an image loader
  + a font loader
+ 🔥 hot module reloading 

### Using the starter

For developent: 

+ `git clone`(this repo)
+ `cd react_starter`
+ `npm install`(wait approx 10 years)
+ `npm run dev`

For production:

+ `npm run build`
